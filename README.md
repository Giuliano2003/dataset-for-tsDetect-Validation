# dataset-for-tsDetect-Validation
I provide a dataset composed of more than 200 classes, collected from two main sources:

Open-source projects on GitHub – real-world codebases that allow me to analyze test smells in practical and diverse contexts.

Automatically generated tests with EvoSuite – synthetic test cases created using the EvoSuite tool, which provide additional coverage and a richer variety of scenarios.

By combining real-world and generated tests, I aim to build a balanced dataset that can be effectively used to evaluate the accuracy and generalizability of test smell detection techniques.
